# World_Weather_Analysis
The purpose of this project was to randomly create pairs of latitudes and longitudes, find the nearest city to those points, use APIs to request weather data for those cities, and create a map with markers showing those cities. I also used Google Maps API to find the nearest hotels to those cities and included them on the map, along with the weather data. There is a dataframe for each dataset used to create the figures.
